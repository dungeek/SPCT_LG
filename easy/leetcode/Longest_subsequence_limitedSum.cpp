2389. Longest Subsequence With Limited Sum

You are given an integer array nums of length n, and an integer array queries of length m.

Return an array answer of length m where answer[i] is the maximum size of a subsequence 
that you can take from nums such that the sum of its elements is less than or equal to queries[i].

A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by 
deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
*/

/*
Approach
Sort the nums array: The key observation is that selecting the smallest elements first 
will allow us to maximize the subsequence size while staying under a given query sum.
Use a prefix sum: Construct a prefix sum array, where prefix[i] represents the sum of the first i elements in the sorted array.
Binary search: For each query, use binary search (std::upper_bound) to find the largest subsequence whose sum is â‰¤ queries[i].
